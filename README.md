Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stop doing business or using products or services of a company within a certain period.

Measures must be taken to prevent customer churn because the cost of acquiring new customers is often higher than retaining existing customers. Moreover, retention usually improves the margins as customers are likely to spend more over a longer period.
